Storage in Browser in js :
JavaScript provides browser-side storage options to store data on a user’s machine. 
These storage mechanisms are crucial for building modern, interactive, and offline-capable web applications.

*Why Storage is Important
Keeps data persistent even after a page reload.
Reduces unnecessary server requests.
Improves performance and user experience.
Enables offline access for Progressive Web Apps (PWAs).

* Why Client-Side Storage Matters
Reduces server requests and saves bandwidth.
Enables offline functionality (Progressive Web Apps).
Stores user preferences and state between sessions.
Improves UX (faster loading, no re-login every time).
Stores large data like files, structured objects, and app data.


types of storage:
1. Local  storage:
    store data permenetly
    key value pairs , stored as string
    max size 5-10 mb depen on brows
    data is store per domain

    🔹 Use Cases:
    Dark/light theme toggle.
    Save app preferences.
    Shopping cart state.
    Caching simple API responses.

    Benefits:
    data persist even after the tab is closed or browser is closed

    Limiation
    only string (need JSON.stringify() for objects)
    not secure for sensetive data
    to secure we need to encrypt the data and use it  back by decrypting

    CRUD:
    create/update 
        localStorage

2. sessionStorage
Definition:
Similar to localStorage but only available per browser tab and cleared on tab close.
Same size limit (~5 MB).
Perfect for temporary data that doesn’t need to persist.        

🔹 Use Cases:
Multi-step forms (keep progress if the page refreshes).
Store temporary tokens (e.g., OAuth).
Storing data in a single tab without affecting other tabs.


3. Cookies
Definition:
Small key-value pairs stored in the browser and sent to the server on every HTTP request.
Max 4 KB.
Can be session cookies (deleted on close) or persistent (expiry date).
Supports flags:


🔹 Use Cases:
Authentication tokens (JWTs, sessions).
Tracking (analytics, ads).
Small preferences shared between server and client.

4. IndexedDB

Definition:
A NoSQL database in the browser.
Stores objects, arrays, files, and blobs.
Works asynchronously and won’t block the main thread.
Suitable for large datasets (hundreds of MBs).


🔹 Use Cases:
Offline web apps (e.g., Gmail, Spotify Web).
Large datasets (images, media files).
Client-side caching of complex objects.


5. Cache API (Service Workers)

Definition:
A browser API for caching network requests and static assets.
Used with service workers to make Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) work offline.

What is the Cache API?

The Cache API is a modern browser storage mechanism that 
lets you store HTTP request-response pairs (like HTML, CSS, JS, images, etc.)
so your app can work offline or load faster.
It’s mostly used in Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) with Service Workers.

Stores entire responses (not just key-value like localStorage).
Can store binary data (images, fonts, videos, etc.).
Designed for offline-first web apps.
Accessible via caches global object in Service Workers and some Window contexts.


🔹 Use Cases:
Offline mode for web apps.
Pre-caching static assets for faster load.
Advanced caching strategies (stale-while-revalidate).
