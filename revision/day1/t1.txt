What is JavaScript?:
        JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language.
        It is mainly used to make web pages interactive.
        It runs directly in the browser without the need for compilation.
        Created in 1995 by Brendan Eich at Netscape.

Key Features
        Client-side language → runs in the user’s browser.
        Lightweight & fast.
        Cross-platform → works on all operating systems and browsers.
        Event-driven → responds to user actions like clicks, typing, scrolling.
        Versatile → used for front-end, back-end (Node.js), mobile apps, and more.

Uses of JavaScript
        Adding interactivity to websites (menus, sliders, pop-ups).
        Validating form data before sending to the server.
        Creating animations and effects.
        Building Single Page Applications (SPA) with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.
        Server-side development using Node.js.

How JavaScript Works
        The browser has a JavaScript Engine (e.g., V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox).
        JavaScript code is executed line-by-line (interpreted).
        Can be included inside HTML using:
        <script>
          alert("Hello, JavaScript!");
        </script>
        Or from an external file:
        <script src="script.js"></script>        

Advantages:
        Easy to learn and use.
        No special setup — runs in any browser.
        Rich ecosystem (libraries & frameworks).
        Works well with HTML & CSS.

Limitations:
        Code is visible to the user (less secure).
        Can be disabled in the browser.
        Performance may be slower for very heavy tasks compared to compiled languages.        

        
| Feature         | Scripting Language                       | Programming Language (Compiled)                    |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Execution**   | Interpreted at runtime                   | Compiled into machine code first                   |
| **Speed**       | Slower (because interpreted)             | Faster (runs directly in machine code)             |
| **Development** | Quick and easy to write/test             | More complex — needs compilation step              |
| **Usage**       | Automating tasks, web scripts, glue code | Full-scale applications, OS, high-performance apps |
| **Examples**    | JavaScript, Python, Bash                 | C, C++, Java, Go                                   |
