data type :
            A data type tells JavaScript what kind of value a variable stores and how it can be used.

Memory type :
        A.  Stack Memory
                        Purpose: Stores primitive values and function call frames (execution context).
                        Stores: Primitive data types (number, string, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) and references to objects.
                        Memory allocation: Static — size is fixed when the variable is created.
                        Access speed: Very fast (LIFO — Last In, First Out).
                        Lifetime: Data is automatically removed when the function scope ends.

        B.  Heap Memory
                        Purpose: Stores non-primitive values (objects, arrays, functions).
                        Stores: Objects, arrays, and functions.
                        Memory allocation: Dynamic — size can grow or shrink at runtime.
                        Access speed: Slower than stack (because you look up a reference).
                        Lifetime: Data stays until garbage collection removes unused objects.

Types of data_type :
        1. Primitive Data Types:   builtin data type
                        These are basic, single values that are immutable (cannot be changed directly).
                        They are stored directly in the stack memory.    
                        eg:string,number,boolean,undefine,null,symbol,..;

        2. Non-Primitive Data Types:  derived data types
                        These store collections or complex structures.
                        They are stored in the heap memory, 
                        and the variable only stores a reference (address) to the data.                
                        eg: array,object,function,...;
